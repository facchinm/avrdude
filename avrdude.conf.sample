# AVRPROG Configuration File
#
# This file contains configuration data used by AVRPROG which describes
# the programming hardware pinouts and also provides part definitions.
# AVRPROG's "-C" command line option specifies the location of the
# configuration file.  The "-c" option names the programmer confiuration
# which must match one of the entry's "id" parameter.  The "-p" option
# identifies which part AVRPROG is going to be programming and must match
# one of the parts' "id" parameter.
#
# Possible entry formats are:
#
#   programmer
#       id     = <id1> [, <id2> [, <id3>] ...] ;  # <idN> are quoted strings
#       desc   = <description> ;                  # quoted string
#       vcc    = <num1> [, <num2> ... ] ;         # pin number(s)
#       reset  = <num> ;                          # pin number
#       sck    = <num> ;                          # pin number
