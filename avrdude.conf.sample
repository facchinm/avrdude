# Programmer Pin Configurations
#
# The format of these entries is as follows:
#   name:[desc=<description>:][[<pin>=<value>:]...]
#
# Example: for a programmer called PGM-1 that uses pin 2 and 3 for
#   power, pins 4, 5, and 6 for RESET, SCK, and MOSI, and pin 10 for
#   MISO, we could use the following entry:
#
#  pgm-1 : desc=Programmer 1:vcc=2,3:reset=4:sck=5:mosi=6:miso=10
#
# Continuation lines are supported, use a backslash (\) as the last
# character of the line and the next line will included as part of the
# configuration data.
