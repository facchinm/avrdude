- Man page needs updated for avr910 info.

- Website needs to link to docs:
  http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/avrdude/doc/avrdude-html/

- [Windows Port] Use Windows API for serial port communications (ser_win32.c).
  (In Progress)
  
- Add "skip empty pages" optimization on avr910 paged write. The stk500 has
  this optimization already.

- Fix "overfull \hbox" issues in building documentation.

- FIXME: term.c: terminal_get_input(): strip newlines in non-readline input 
  code.

- FIXME: avr910.c: avr910_initialize(): Need to lookup devcode and report the 
  device.
  
- FIXME: avr910.c: avr910_cmd(): Insert version check here.

- FIXME: ser_posix.c: serial_close(): Should really restore the terminal to 
  original state here.
