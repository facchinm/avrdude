General:

- Man page needs updated for avr910 info.

- avr910 needs a little bit of work to support setting fuse byte (note that it
  can only deal with a _single_ fuse byte.

- Website needs to link to docs:
  http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/avrdude/doc/avrdude-html/

Windows:

- Use Windows API for stk500 serial port communications on Windows port.
  This might remove dependency on Cygwin.
  
- Add ability to find all parallel port names available and base addresses
  of available ports.
