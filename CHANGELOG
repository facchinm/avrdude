Approximate change log for AVRPROG by version

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Latest:

  * Work around problem programming fuse bits on parts like the
    at90s4433 as described in the following errata:

      http://www.atmel.com/atmel/acrobat/doc1280.pdf

  * Add part definition for at90s4414, at90s4433.

  * Add fuse/lock bit memory instructions for the at90s1200,
    at90s2333, at90s4433 and at90s8515.

  * Fix setting of programmer status LEDs under certain write-fail
    conditions.


Version 2.0.2 :

  * Fix writing to read-only memories such as the lock bits of the
    AT90S2313.

  * Copyright updates.


Version 2.0.1 :

  * Use correct parallel port pins for VCC.

  * Add programmer definition for Atmel's STK200.

  * Add programmer definition for the AVR3 board.

  * Fix address bit encoding for many parts.

  * Allow the ``BUFF'' signal to be asserted by multiple pins of the
    parallel port (like VCC) instead of just one.  The STK200 appears
    to need this feature.


Version 2.0.0 :

  * Add support for programming fuse and lock bits if supported by the
    part.

  * Move instruction encoding into the config file.  Now any part can
    be supported as long as it uses the same basic serial programming
    instruction format.

  * Add part definitions for the ATMega163 and ATMega8 devices.


Version 1.4.3 :

  * Mostly internal code cleanup.


Version 1.4.2 :

  * Fixes for ATMega paged memory support.

  * Support for ATMega16 device.


Version 1.4.1 :

  * No functional changes, update to Copyrights only.


Version 1.4.0 :

  * Add part definitions to the config file.

  * Add initial support for Atmel's ATMega paged memory parts.

  * Config file documentation added.

  * Add a definition for the Dontronics DT006 programmer.

  * Fix Intel Hex support for addresses larger than 64k.


Version 1.3.0 :

  * Make programmer pin assignments configurable.


Version 1.2.2 :

  * Initial public release
