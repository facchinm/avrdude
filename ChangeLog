	* butterfly.c (butterfly_initialize): when sending the 'T'
	command (which is ignored by current AVR109 bootloaders),
	send the first reply from the list of supported device
	codes back rather than using avrdude.conf's idea about
	an AVR910 device code.  Apparently, this solves disagreements
	between different versions of at least the ATmega8 AVR910
	device code.
	Closes bug #18727: Writing flash failed

	Reported by Till Harbaum:
	* avrdude.conf.in (ATtiny25/45/85): Change HVSP reset from
	500 microseconds to 1 ms, matching the most recent Atmel XML
	specs.
