2003-03-05  Joerg Wunsch <j@uriah.heep.sax.de>

	* avrdude.conf.in: Add a definition for the popular Ponyprog dongle.

	Submitted by:	Daniel Williamson <dannyw@maconmgt.co.uk>

2003-03-05  Brian S. Dean  <bsd@bsdhome.com>

	* main.c:
	Check the programmer type against 'STK500' instead of the programmer
	name when checking to see if we should default to the default_serial
	port instead of the default_parallel port.  This has us do the right
	thing for the new 'avrisp' programmer.

	* stk500.c:
	Make the page size used for non-paged parts for the 'paged_write'
	command be 128 bytes.  This cuts 6 seconds off the programming time
	for uploading a 6K file into an AT90S8515 vs the time loading the same
	file using a 16 byte buffer, and the response feedback is still good.

	* avr.c, stk500.c:
	Fix stk500 page write (Program Page command).  This is supported after
	all on non-paged-memory parts.  The problem was that the page size was
	defaulting to 256 (maximum for the stk500), but the timeout for a
	response from the stk500 before declaring it dead was only 0.5
	seconds.  But it takes much longer than 0.5 seconds to program 256
	bytes, so we just weren't waiting long enough.

	Fix this in two ways - increase the timeout to 5 seconds, and decrease
	the page size to 16 bytes for non-paged parts.  The programming time
	for 16 bytes is short enough to provide the user with some feedback
	that something is happening.

	* avr.c, stk500.c:
	Don't call the programmer's 'paged_write' routine unless the memory
	itself is paged as it doesn't appear to work otherwise.

	* avrdude.conf.in: Fix device codes for at90s8515 and at90s8535.

	* avrdude.conf.in:
	Add PAGEL and BS2 parms for parts I have datasheets for.

	* config_gram.y:
	Do that last commit slightly differently - this way results in no
	shift-reduce conflicts.

	* config_gram.y:
	It shouldn't be an error to have an empty configuration file.  This
	causes some shift-reduce conflicts, but I think they are OK.

	* main.c:
	Print out a list of valid parts for '-p ?' and a list of valid
	programmers for '-c ?'.

2003-03-04  Eric Weddington <eric@umginc.net>

	* doc/avrdude.texi: Minor Windows doc corrections.

	* doc/TODO: Add TODO file.

2003-03-04  Brian S. Dean  <bsd@bsdhome.com>

	* stk500.c:

	haven't been specified in the config file for the part.

	* stk500.c: Set extended device parameters for all firmware versions.

	* stk500.c:
	First attempt at supporting STK500 firmware past 1.10.  Thanks to
	Jason Kyle for the needed protocol information.

2003-03-03  Theodore A. Roth  <troth@openavr.org>

	"bootstrap".  Back out that change.

	* bootstrap, lexer.l:
	Ignore \r as white space, to make the Windows people happy.

2003-02-27  Theodore A. Roth  <troth@openavr.org>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add avrdude.spec and make entries one
	per line so future patches are obvious as to what changed.
	* avrdude.spec.in: New file to support creation of binaries in rpm
	format.
	* configure.ac (AC_OUTPUT): Add avrdude.spec.  Reorder so that
	Makefile is the last entry.

	avrdude.conf.in.
	Remove avrdude.conf and distclean-local rules.
	Add install-exec-local and backup-avrdude-conf rules.
	* avrdude.conf.in:
	Set default_parallel to "@DEFAULT_PAR_PORT@" for autoconf expansion.
	Set default_serial to "@DEFAULT_SER_PORT@" for autoconf expansion.
	* configure.ac: Add call to AC_CANONICAL_{BUILD,HOST,TARGET} macros.
	Set DEFAULT_PAR_PORT and DEFAULT_SER_PORT based on $host.
	Add copyright header.
	Define avrdude_version so AC_INIT and AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE are sure
	to get the same version.

	* avrdude.conf.in, avrdude.conf.sample:
	Renamed avrdude.conf.sample to avrdude.conf.in.

2003-02-24  Joerg Wunsch <j@uriah.heep.sax.de>

	* avrdude.1: Atmel has rearranged their web site, so now the AVR
	docs have been moved to a more logically sounding URL.

2003-02-24  Eric Weddington <eric@umginc.net>

	* Makefile.am, main.c: Integrate Windows search of config files.

	* confwin.c, confwin.h: config file search on Windows.

	* ppiwin.c: Change port value from lpt1alt to lpt3. Other
	formatting changes.

	* main.c: Usage back to stderr.

2003-02-22  Brian S. Dean  <bsd@bsdhome.com>

	* CHANGELOG: Add note about .avrduderc.

	* avr.c, avrdude.conf.sample, avrpart.h, config_gram.y, main.c,
	* par.c, pgm.c, pgm.h:
	Add the ability to read a per-user config file located at
	$HOME/.avrduderc.  Entries from .avrduderc take precedence over those
	from the system wide config file in ${PREFIX}/etc/avrdude.conf.

	Track and display the config file name and line number when we print
	out the available parts and programmers.  This is useful in case
	someone has overridden a definition in their .avrduderc file and is
	wondering why the definition in the system wide config file is not
	being used.

	Remove the default programmer 'stk500' from the distributed config
	file.

	* CHANGELOG: Spelling.

2003-02-21  Brian S. Dean  <bsd@bsdhome.com>

	* CHANGELOG:
	Put some stuff in the CHANGELOG for this upcoming new version before I
	forget.

	* main.c:
	Update comment due to removal of the default parallel port pin config.

	* config.c, config.h, config_gram.y, lexer.l, main.c:
	* avrdude.conf.sample:
	Introduce 'default_programmer' to the config file instead of requiring
	one of the programmers to be tagged "default" within its definition.

	Also, axe the notion of a compiled-in default programmer.  It is
	kind've pointless now that nearly all configuration comes from the
	config file, thus, avrdude is not very useful without the config file,
	and thus, having a programmer compiled-in offers little or no benefit.

2003-02-21  Eric Weddington <eric@umginc.net>

	* main.c: Change usage text to be verbose.

	* giveio.sys: Add Windows parallel port device driver (binary).

	* install_giveio.bat, remove_giveio.bat, status_giveio.bat:
	Windows batch files to work with giveio.sys.

2003-02-21  Brian S. Dean  <bsd@bsdhome.com>

	* avrdude.conf.sample, config.c, config.h, config_gram.y, lexer.l:
	* main.c:
	Add port name defaults to the config file instead of hard-coding.
	This adds 'default_parallel' and 'default_serial' keywords to the
	grammar, which take quoted string arguments.

	* avrdude.conf.sample:
	Document the recent additions to the config file.

	* stk500.c, avr.c, avrpart.h, config_gram.y, lexer.l, par.c:
	Add the ability to specify which pin to pulse when retrying entry into
	programming mode.  Use 'retry_pulse' in the per-part specification
	that can currently take values of 'reset' or 'sck', the default being
	'sck' which preserves the previous behaviour.  Some newer parts
	indicate that /RESET should be pulsed, while older parts say to pulse
	SCK.

2003-02-20  Eric Weddington <eric@umginc.net>

	* main.c, par.c:
	Make verbose global. Make debug code in par_cmd() based on verbose=2.

2003-02-20  Brian S. Dean  <bsd@bsdhome.com>

	* stk500.c: Fix pseudo/full parallel mode selection logic.

	* avrdude.conf.sample:
	Woops, didn't really mean to commit those changes that slipped in with
	the last commit.  Those were just there for testing.

	* avr.c, avrdude.conf.sample, avrpart.h, config_gram.y, lexer.l:
	* stk500.c:
	Add 'serial' and 'parallel' keywords to the grammar so that one can
	say whether parts support these programming modes or not.  Possible
	values for 'serial' are 'yes' or 'no'.  Possible values for 'parallel'
	are 'yes', 'no', or 'pseudo'.  Add a bit mask of flags to the AVRPART
	structure to capture these settings.  Use these within
	stk500_initialize() to set the device parameters correctly.

	Defaults for 'serial' and 'parallel' are 'yes' unless specified
	otherwise.

2003-02-20  Eric Weddington <eric@umginc.net>

	* Makefile.am, ppiwin.c: Get rid of CRs.

	* Makefile.am: Add ppiwin.c to avrdude_SOURCES.

2003-02-20  Brian S. Dean  <bsd@bsdhome.com>

	* avr.c, avrdude.conf.sample, avrpart.h, config_gram.y, lexer.l:
	Add a few parameters needed for parallel programming: assignment of
	PAGEL and BS2 signals and the disposition of the reset pin
	('dedicated' or 'io').

	building in a separate dir works.

2003-02-15  Joerg Wunsch <j@uriah.heep.sax.de>

	* Makefile.am:
	Only GNU make sets $< in non-inference rules, so rather explicitly
	spell the source file(s) to remain compatible.

2003-02-14  Theodore A. Roth  <troth@openavr.org>

	* Makefile.am: Add distclean rule and EXTRA_DIST list to get 'make

	* stk500.c: Fix typos.  Fix error messages.

2003-02-13  Brian S. Dean  <bsd@bsdhome.com>

	* Makefile, avrdude.conf.sample, config_gram.y, lexer.l, main.c:
	* par.c, par.h, ppi.c, ppi.h, stk500.c:
	Split higher level parallel port programmer code off from ppi.c into
	its own file par.c, leaving low level parallel port accessor routines
	in ppi.c to help with portability.  Change the programmer type to
	'PAR' now instead of 'PPI' - 'PAR' represents the parallel port
	programmer type.

	Be more liberal with 'static' function declarations within the
	programmer implimentation files - these functions should never be
	called directly - always use the programmer function references.

	There are still a few places in 'main.c' that directly reference the
	parallel programmer explicitly (par_getpinmask).  These should be
	fixed somehow.

	Axe a few unused functions.

2003-02-12  Theodore A. Roth  <troth@openavr.org>

	* .cvsignore: New file.

	* stk500.c: Remove need for inttypes.h.

	* lexer.l: Define YY_NO_UNPUT to quell a compiler warning.

	* Makefile: Remove YACC assignment.
	Add '-b y' options to YACC invocation.
	Remove leading '-' from 'include .depend'.

2003-02-12  Joerg Wunsch <j@uriah.heep.sax.de>

	* config_gram.y:
	Declare the internally used static functions on top, to get rid of the
	compiler warnings.

	Reported by:	bison-generated parsers

2003-02-11  Theodore A. Roth  <troth@openavr.org>

	* linux_ppdev.h: New file.
	* ppi.c: Include system dependant parallel port interface file.
	(ppi_open): Add call to ppi_claim().
	(ppi_close): Add call to ppi_release().
	* ppi.h: Define ppi_claim() and ppi_release() as NOPs if not previously
	defined.
	* stk500.c: Include inttypes header to quell compiler warning.

2003-02-11  Joerg Wunsch <j@uriah.heep.sax.de>

	* pgm.c, ppi.c, stk500.c: Fix some implicit declaration warnings.

	* config_gram.y:
	Move the C declarations to the top of the file.  While [b]yacc doesn't
	care, bison does, and this is normally the way it's meant to be
	anyway.

2003-02-11  Theodore A. Roth  <troth@openavr.org>

	* Makefile: Generate dependencies specific to the target system.
	Explicitly use byacc.

	* Makefile:
	Remove reference to avr-gcc in depend rule (cut & paste error).

2003-02-06  Brian S. Dean  <bsd@bsdhome.com>

	* avrdude.1: Update license to GPL, permission by Joerg Wunsch.

	* lexer.l: Add GPL.

	* Makefile, config_gram.y: Add GPL to the Makefile and config_gram.y.

	* Makefile, stk500.h:
	Add stk500.h as a dependency for stk500.c.  Remove carraige returns
	from stk500.h - don't know how those got in there (pointed out by Ted
	Roth).

	Get rid of the verbose printing of individual file CVS version ids.
	This was intended to be used for identifying code in the field for
	incoming bug reports, but I've never really found it all that useful.

	* CHANGELOG, Makefile, Makefile.inc, avr.c, avrdude.1:

	* term.c:
	Change the name from AVRPROG to AVRDUDE.

	This change represents a name change only.  There is currently an
	effort to port AVRPROG to other platforms including Linux and Windows.
	Since Atmel's programmer binary that's included within their AVR
	Studio software is named AVRPROG.EXE on the Windows OS, there is the
	chance for confusion if we keep calling this program AVRPROG as well.
	Up until now the name hasn't really been a problem since there was no
	chance to confuse 'avrprog' on Unix with Atmel's AVRPROG because
	Atmel's tools only run on Windows.  But with the Unix 'avrprog'
	possibly being ported to Windows, I felt a name change was the best
	way to avoid problems.

	So - from this point forward, my FreeBSD Unix program formerly
	known as AVRPROG will subsequently be known as AVRDUDE (AVR
	Downloader/UploaDEr).

	This change also represents a time when the AVRDUDE sources move from
	my own private repository to a public repository.  This will give
	other developers a chance to port AVRDUDE to other platforms and
	extend its functionality to support additional programming hardware,
	etc.

	So goodbye AVRPROG, welcome AVRDUDE!
