	* usb_libusb.c (usbdev_open): Downgrade the max transfer size for
	the main data endpoints when being forced so by the USB; this can
	happen when attaching the JTAGICE3 to a USB 1.1 connection
	* jtag3.c (jtag3_initialize): When detecting a downgraded max
	transfer size on the JTAGICE3 (presumably, due to being connected
	to USB 1.1 only), bail out as its firmware cannot properly handle
	this (by now)
